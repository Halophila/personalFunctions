# personalFunctions
Little functions that help analyze and graph

`equationPrinter` will generate an object with a linear regression equation and R<sup>2</sup> from a lm model. These can be added to a ggplot via `annotate`.

``` R
> ##example
> a = 1:10
> b = a * 2
> equationPrinter(lm(b ~ a))
[1] "italic(y) == 2 ~italic(x) +0" "italic(r)^2 == 1"  
```

`csvBinder` will collate all CSV files in a directory into a single dataframe by rows, matching columns.
